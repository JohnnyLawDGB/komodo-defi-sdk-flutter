/// `gap_limit` is the BIP-44 **consecutive-empty** tolerance, not a count of
/// addresses to probe. KDF walks forward from `known_addresses_number`,
/// incrementing a counter on each unused address and **resetting it to zero on
/// each used one** (`mm2src/coins/lp_coins.rs:6448-6450`), stopping once the
/// counter exceeds the limit. So on an all-empty wallet a scan costs
/// `gap_limit + 1` probes, and on a wallet with history the limit decides how
/// long a run of unused addresses the scan will step over before giving up.
///
/// KDF's own docs state the consequence plainly: *"If transactions were sent to
/// an address outside the `gap_limit`, they will not be identified when
/// scanning."* Lowering it is therefore a trade of node requests against how
/// much of a restored wallet's history the app can still see - and the failure
/// is silent, showing a balance that is simply too low.
///
/// One probe is not one request. For an *unused* EVM address KDF issues
/// `eth_getTransactionCount`, then `eth_getBalance`, then one
/// `eth_call balanceOf` per ERC-20 registered on the platform coin
/// (`mm2src/coins/eth/eth_hd_wallet.rs:125-150`). The nonce short-circuit only
/// fires on addresses that *are* used, so a gap walk over empty addresses pays
/// the full price every time: GLEEC with six GRC-20 tokens costs 8 requests per
/// probe, so 21 probes is 168 requests against an endpoint measured at ~20/s.
